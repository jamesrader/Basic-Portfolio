                <p>I am a full-stack web developer. I have experience with the MERN stack (not yet - Haha!), PHP, MySQL,
                    HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, and Git version control. I also have expertise in video
                    and audio production using tools like Avid Media Composer, Avid Pro Tools, and Adobe Premiere,
                    After Effects, Photoshop and Illustrator. I have a background in education through 5 years of
                    teaching and 1 year of serving as department chair of a bachelor degree program which I built. This
                    wide range of experience makes me very capable and comfortable with "speaking the language" of other 
                    business units within a company.</p>
                <p>I enjoy spending my spare time with my wife and kids. We travel quite a bit, and I play a lot of
                    Rocket League on the Xbox One with my 7 year-old son (who is probably a little better than me!).</p>
                <p>Please take a look at my portfolio and contact me to let me know what you think.</p>
